mc app with location and camera
This is a flutter app for when I am driving my bike. 
It is based on SJ4000 WIFI action camera. Phone is connected to SJ4000 on internal camera WIFI link. 
I use the URLs on the camera webservice to take photos and download to Phone Download area. 
I also use google map to take lat, lng while I am driving.
So when I press add() on phone,then I take photo, download photo to phone, take location, save filename+data to list, save data to json file in Download. 
So after a bike ride I have my own route with lat, lng and images. I can also delete files again. Update will soon come.
Next part is to make a new page where I upload all data from download folder to webserver to have routes. 

Contact me if you have any questions. mikommd@gmail.com, thanks
